Version history - CrazyBus
==========================
2.00 (Momohime - 18/03/2010)
Thanks to the YouTube(tm) community, i was reminded to blow off the dust from the code and the project :)
- Built on the greatest and latest BasiEgaXorz 1.37
- Crash-tested on Kega Fusion (3.63x) and Gens/GS (r7) under Linux x86_64
- Dozens of fresh and hot pictures, now with more visual quality! (all those shots snagged by me, your host ;)
- Almost total code rewrite
- The "evil" music is now (slighty) customizable. Bring your own entropy by mashing buttons randomly! Run it on a PAL console for extra fun!
- Optimized pictures using tilemaps. Less memory, more savings, we've gone green
- Realistic sound for the bus horn (inspired on electric horns from some doubledecker busses)
- Smooth scrolling on the bus selector (as it should have been implemented from the beginning :)
- Fixed dozens of on-screen drawing bugs and artifacts
- "Reverse" alarm, just like modern busses
- Total overhaulin' to the playfield
- Removed ALL debugging messages
- And much more...
I'm now waiting for your videos and your destructive comments! This version is dedicated to all those BoobTube critics...

1.1 (29/10/05)
- Now compiled with BEX 0.26 BETA, this fixes most minor BEX-related nasty bugs :P
- Finally, fixed the nasty sound bugs on playfield related with horn and bus engine. Now bus horn sounds always when you hit A, and shutdowns when you release A (did not worked OK on earlier versions)
- Also fixed some playfield drawing, replaced all PRINTs with DRAWTILEs & FOR loops. Now the "transparent" layer appears OK, with no gaps
- Corrected some minor errors in the trades titlecard
- As usual, minor cleanups here and there...
- Now selected bus name appears in the playfield
- Again, a minor correction to the Jum Buss model: i forgot the rear-view mirror!
- Fixed random number generation... removed too many RANDOMIZEs that caused repeated numbers instead of "pure" random numbers. This should rotate between the many background images without too many effort.

1.0 (09/09/05)
